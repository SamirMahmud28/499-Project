# ResearchGPT: A Multi-Agent Chat System for Research Paper Writing

Build ResearchGPT, a domain-optimized multi-agent LLM system that helps students and early-career researchers plan, research, draft, and refine full research papers with a purposeful, problem-solving dialogue.The system is human-in-the-loop, meaning users can approve, edit, or re-run outputs at each phase, and can export a finalized paper in structured LaTeX.

## 🎯 Objective
Build a domain-optimized, multi-agent LLM system that produces purposeful, problem-solving dialogue and reliably generates high-quality academic/technical documents (research papers, reports, proposals, and slide outlines).
- Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO) to continuously improve task-specific prompts
- Pruning / quantization + model routing to reduce latency and cost
- Domain-specific fine-tuning (e.g., LoRA/QLoRA) for academic writing style and consistency
- Quality-control loops (critic + checkpoints) to improve coherence and reduce unsupported claims
