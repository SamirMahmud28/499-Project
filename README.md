# TalkWise â€” Purposeful Dialogue with an Optimized Domain-Specific LLM

This project aims to develop a domain-optimized large language model (LLM) capable of engaging in purposeful, goal-driven dialogues. Unlike general-purpose models (e.g., ChatGPT), our approach focuses on structured, problem-solving interactions while maintaining efficiency for real-world and edge deployments.
